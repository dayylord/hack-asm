# Nand2Tetris Part I - Week 6 - Project

* This GO program translates hack assembly language spec to binary as rquired by the course
* Takes one cli arg which is the name of the file containing hack assembly language 
* And creates a new file in the current directory with the extension asma containing binary strings

# Disclaimer
* Written in hopes of learning GO so its very newbie  
* There is not much error handling other than bare minium that GO forces
* Everything is hardcoded, nothing fancy just two files with full of functions and then some more
